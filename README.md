 Tron Style Snakes Game as AI Testbed

** Imported from google code archive **


Snakes battle, the winner is the last one moving.

Designed to make it easy to plug in AI. All you have to do is implement a simple Java interface.

Provide a bunch of sample AIs, including one that is superhuman in strength. To play against the superhuman AI, just download and launch the jar files, you always start in the bottom right; use arrows for controls.

NOTE: to run this project, you will need at least JDK 6.
